        value: |
          Anything not related to a particular forum or channel will be removed without warning.

          Channels may also have their own rules, copies of which can be found in this channel or in the channel topic.
      - name: ":two: Spoilers should be marked."
        value: |
          Either make use of ||spoiler|| tags or add the `#spoiler` tag (if one is available) *or utilize the thread title as a general warning*. You are guaranteed to spoil aspects of a game, film or show episode if it involves discussing the plot that unfolds.

          If you are unsure of the spoilers your content may discuss, ask a moderator (you may be pulled into a thread).
