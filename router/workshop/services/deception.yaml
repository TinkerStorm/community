          ... and it was abandoned due to the pressure of the policy changes that Discord made, as well as my university studies. I was forced to choose, and despite that, it continues to be my greatest regret to this day - not even sure I will ever be able to forgive myself for it either.

          Much of the notes that I made and the attempts at bringing it to life still remain, but is not in a state that I would be proud to show off. `Deception` is intended to be it's successor, and with the advancements on Discord since it's prior demise, I hope I can rectify my mistakes and make something that I can be proud of.

          Until then, we'll take it one step at a time and make sure amends are made.
