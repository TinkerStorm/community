      🃏 How can we shuffle a deck of cards in a way that is **consistent** and **fair**?
      💢 What are the **implications** of different approaches?
      🤔 How can we use this to **our advantage**?

      *A look into how different approaches can effect the results of a shuffle, and the implications that come with them at scale.*

      > Closely associated with <@&884607905914036245>'s progress, which will eventually use this to determine what cards are in the deck and how they are distributed to players.
