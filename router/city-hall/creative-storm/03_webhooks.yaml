      Some channels provide access to webhooks, allowing for use of embeds or link components. If you'd like to use one, please ask a staff member.

      Breaking the terms of privileges granted to you by <@&892435570926706688>, may result in the removal of your privileges or extend to general enforcement to ensure the safety of our community.

      But first, a few things you should know...

    fields:
      - name: ":bust_in_silhouette: Authorship"
        value: |
          Use of webhooks is limited to the author of a post, limiting the chance of abusing access by falsely claiming permission.
      - name: ":information_source: Initial post"
        value: >
          The first message *can* originate from a webhook, but you should note yourself as the author in the first message (either as the username or as part of the message body).
      - name: ":warning: Use of links"
        value: |
          Use of link components and masked links are limited to a few roles.

          *This means you must contribute to the community in some way to use these features. Exemptions are possible, but **extremely rare** to come across - asking for an exemption / bypass, does not get you anywhere near for that matter.*
