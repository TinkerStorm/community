      > *Got a topic which you like, but aren't very confident with?*
      > *Or would prefer to see someone else take up the opportunity?*

      Share your ideas, your theories and your thoughts here, and let someone else take the lead. *Mention the forum channel you think it would fit in, and any appropriate tags that would fit.*

      We would very much like to here what your ideas are, and anyone is free to pickup other ideas and write for <#1019643103088476200> or <#1019642988940500992>.

      *As much as we would like to refer to these as channel rules, we would rather refer to them as guidelines. They are likely to adapt as demand increases.*

          Typically, viewers of this channel will pickup on a title that stands out the most. Others, may select a more nuanced or less detailed focus point to expand on.

          While we would ask that if authors posting from a topic inspiration in this channel credit the author, don't be surprised if it doesn't happen.
      
      - name: ":two: Use ||spoilers|| appropriately."
        value: >
          If you intend to discuss pivotal points of your topic that others may want to discover for themselves, please use `||spoiler||` tags at your discretion.
          We ask that you use your best judgement for when your topic is or was a 'hot-topic' on social media.
      
      - name: ":three: Excess content"
        value: |
          You are free to use as much of your character limit (2k / 4k for Nitro+) for a single topic. But we ask that if you are to go beyond that limit, please use an external host like [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/), [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) or [Hastebin](https://hastebin.com/).

          *Future service expansion may permit the hosting of a local hastebin-like instance.*

          > When creating a post from this channel, be sure to include the `#Recycled` tag and mention the author source in your first message with a message link. This will help us keep track of where the idea came from, and who to credit. *If you're unsure of how to do this, ask a staff member.*
