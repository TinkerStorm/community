      Smaller projects that didn't get their own repository, but still have a distinct function separate from anything else. These are usually a one-off, but can be used as a reference for other projects. Keep in mind that these may be outdated, and may not work as originally intended.

      If you would be interested in seeing one of these projects explored further, please let us know in <#684015009755693071>.
